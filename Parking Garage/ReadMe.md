### Parking Garage

## About
This a small implementation for a company's parking system. The xyz company has 3 buildings (A, B and C)
and each building has 6 floors for parking and each parking floor has 100 parking spots. The implementation
is done with a 3-dimensional array which contains all the parking spots across the buildings.

## parkingGarage.h
Imports- stdlib.h for rand().

# 3 Dimensional Array
This is the header file which has the implementation of 3D array named parkingData. This array has the values:
1 and 0s. 1 indicates that there is already a car in that parking spot. 0 indicates that parking spot is empty.
After initialization, the nested for loops assigns each spot a value. To fill them randomly, I used the rand() function
and set the limits to 0 and 1.
